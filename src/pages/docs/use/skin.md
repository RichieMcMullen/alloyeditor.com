###### Skins in AlloyEditor are a very powerful feature that allows you to seamlessly integrate the editor inside your app.

<article id="article1">

## Skin Architecture

<p>
	AlloyEditor skins are organized according to the following principles:
</p>


<p>
	<strong>Variables</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Style values are parameterized as much as possible. This allows skins to fully extend others just by changing a small set of variable values.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Components</strong>
</p>

<p>
	A skin is created by combining one or more components together. Different skins may use different components, so irrelevant styling can be easily stripped out.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Structure vs Skin</strong>
</p>

<p>
	All styling is separated into structure and skin. Structure represents everything that affects the sizing and position of the elements. Meanwhile, skin represents all the purely cosmetic changes.
